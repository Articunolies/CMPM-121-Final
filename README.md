## How we satisfied the software requirements
### [F0.a] 
In the game the character is controled by using WASD on the keyboard. The character will then move in the direction of the key clicked. The character is able to move in 8 directions and able to walk anywhere on the map. The character is able to move through the 2D grid of our world. The grid is outlined by green and the player has a green hitbox aroudn them.

## Reflection

# Devlog Entry 0- [11/15/2024]

## Introducing the team
Tools Lead: Derek Simpson
Will research alternative tools, identify good ones, and help every other team member set them up on their own machine in the best 
configuration for this project. Might also establish the team’s coding style guidelines and help peers setup auto-formatting systems. 
Will provide support for systems like source control and automated deployment (if appropriate to the team’s approach).

Engine Lead: William Klunder
Will research alternative engines, get buy-in from teammates on the choice, and teach peers how to use it if it is new to them. 
This might involve making small code examples outside of the main game project to teach others. Will also establish standards for which kinds of code 
should be organized into which folders of the project and try to propose software designs that insulate the rest of the team from many details of the 
underlying engine.

Design Lead: Justin Lam
Responsible for setting the creative direction of the project, and establishing the look and feel of the game. Will make small art or 
code samples for others to help them contribute and maintain game content. Where the project might involve a domain-specific language, 
this person (who is still an engineer in this class) will lead the discussion as to what primitive elements the language needs to provide.
## Tools and materials

We will be using Phaser as our engine and the browser to deploy our game on the WEB. Phaser uses WebGL to deploy a game on the web. We intend to use phaser
because it is an easy and efficient engine that can help us develop our game. Phaser is also a known engine that doesn't require a lot of learning to use which makes
the researching technologies process much easier. Phaser also works well with github pages, so we are able to deploy and iterate our game well using github,

We will be using Javascript and JSON (for saving data and Tiled). Phaser can use Javascript to compile a web based game. Phaser also can take in a JSON file that
contains Tilemap information that references attached images. Javascript is also a well documented language with a lot of libraries that we can use to help us use
abstract ideas for our game. 

We will be using GitHub for version control. Visual Studio Code will be our choice of IDE because we can use its LiveServer extension to test and practice CI/CD. 
Tiled will be used to create tilemaps and levels that the player can interact with. We will also use GitHub pages to publish our game online. We chose
these tools because the entire team is skilled in using these tools to develop an interactive game. 

Typescript will be our alternate platform choice. Phaser can use Typescript to implement and compile video games using yarn and Nodejs. It also shouldn't be too hard of a switch 
since they are sister languages. We will still be using HTML to deploy it on the web, so our deployment system won't be comprimised by the language change. 


## Outlook

The three of us would like to develop a small but well-made game. Since we all have many other commitments, we will strive to write good, 
maintainable code during development so we can get more done with less time. We anticipate meeting design specifications to be hardest part of the project, 
and hope that our goal of writing maintainable code will help us overcome this. By approaching this project with the tools and materials selected above, 
we hope to learn how to do the things we've been learning throughout this class but now within a team setting.
